# AI Collaboration Record (AGENTS.md)

This document records the contributions of AI agents in the development of the **Engineer Career Simulator**. This project is a product of a collaborative effort between a human developer and AI.

## Agent Information

- **Agent Name**: Antigravity
- **Capabilities**: Full-stack web development, dynamic asset generation, and architectural design.

## Core Contributions

### 🕹️ Game Engine & Logic
- Designed the state management system using React's `useReducer` to handle complex game states (Year/Season, Status, History).
- Implemented the core simulation mechanics, including action costs, effect calculations, and random event triggers.
- Developed a descriptive logging system that provides feedback based on gameplay outcomes.

### 🎨 Design & User Experience
- Crafted a modern, dark-themed UI using **Vanilla CSS**, focusing on premium aesthetics and responsive layout.
- Implemented a dual-pane interface (Event/History Log on left, Status/Actions on right) for an intuitive gameplay experience.
- Added micro-interactions, such as auto-scrolling history logs and modal transitions.

### 🖼️ Asset Generation
- Orchestrated the creation of custom anime-style illustrations using AI image generation tools to match the game's theme:
    - Dedicated scenes for **Job Interviews** and **Social Media Posting**.
    - Consistent character representation across different activities.

## Development Stack & Tools
- **Framework**: Vite + React
- **Language**: TypeScript (Strict Typing)
- **Styling**: Vanilla CSS (Custom Properties)
- **AI Stack**: Antigravity Agent, AI Image Generation Tools
